# File-Sorter

<h2>General info</h2>  
It's my first project, been coding for just a few days and decided it was time to try and put the things i've learned in practice.  
The code is absolutely not polished and even i can see a couple of imperfections.  
  
<h2> What does it do </h2>  
In reality what this program do is simple:  
It takes the files from a starting folder and put the in a target folder; in addition the files are also sorted in sub-folders depending on the name.  
It can sort multiple file with different extensions in a single run, this by asking the user specifically what type of file he's interested in sorting.  
  
There are some obvious problems, one above any other:  
The files must all be named in the following way xxx.txt or xxx1.txt/xxx2.txt and so on. This is the first feature that would be interesting to add.
